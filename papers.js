    title: "Compressibility Measures for Affinely Singular Random Vectors",

    where: "Submitted to IEEE Transaction on Information Theory",
	abs: "There are several ways to measure the compressibility of a random measure; they include general approaches, such as using the rate-distortion curve, as well as more specific notions, such as the Renyi information dimension (RID), and dimensional-rate bias (DRB). The RID parameter indicates the concentration of the measure around lower-dimensional subsets of the space while the DRB parameter specifies the compressibility of the distribution over these lower-dimensional subsets. While the evaluation of such compressibility parameters is well-studied for continuous and discrete measures (e.g., the DRB is closely related to the entropy and differential entropy in discrete and continuous cases, respectively), the case of discrete-continuous measures is quite subtle. In this paper, we focus on a class of multi-dimensional random measures that have singularities on affine lower-dimensional subsets. This class of distributions naturally arises when considering linear transformation of component-wise independent discrete-continuous random variables. Here, we evaluate the RID and DRB for such probability measures. We further provide an upper-bound for the RID of multi-dimensional random measures that are obtained by Lipschitz functions of component-wise independent discrete-continuous random variables (X). The upper-bound is shown to be achievable when the Lipschitz function is AX, where A satisfies SPARK(A) = rank(A) + 1 (e.g., Vandermonde matrices). When considering discrete-domain moving-average processes with non-Gaussian excitation noise, the above results allow us to evaluate the block-average RID and DRB, as well as to determine a relationship between these parameters and other existing compressibility measures.

	abs: "The Renyi's information dimension (RID) of an n-dimensional random vector (RV) is the average dimension of the vector when accounting for non-zero probability measures over lower-dimensional subsets. From an information-theoretical perspective, the RID can be interpreted as a measure of compressibility of a probability distribution. While the RID for continuous and discrete measures is well understood, the case of a discrete-continuous measures presents a number of interesting subtleties. In this paper, we investigate the RID for a class of multi-dimensional discrete-continuous random measures with singularities on affine lower dimensional subsets. This class of RVs, which we term affinely singular, arises from linear transformation of orthogonally singular RVs, that include RVs with singularities on affine subsets parallel to principal axes. We obtain the RID of affinely singular RVs and derive an upper bound for the RID of Lipschitz functions of orthogonally singular RVs. As an application of our results, we consider the example of a moving-average stochastic process with discrete-continuous excitation noise and obtain the RID for samples of this process. We also provide insight about the relationship between the block-average information dimension of the truncated samples, the minimum achievable compression rate, and other measures of compressibility for this process.",

    title: "Correlation Measures for Random Variables Derived from Innovation Processes",
    pdfurl: "",
    where: "(To be submitted)",
	abs: "Studying the statistical dependence of two or several random variables is the basis of statistical estimation and prediction. The correlation measures such as mutual information, Pearson correlation, and maximal correlation are common tools in quantifying the extent to which two random variables are dependent. While such measures are highly informative and computationally simple for jointly Gaussian random variables, it is not the case for general random variables. Infinitely divisible random variables are typical examples that are characterized in the Fourier domain (characteristic functions are known); except for a few special cases, no closed-form expressions are available for the probability density function of such random variables. Besides, these random variables are widely used in the framework of sparse stochastic processes; the latter provides a general statistical formulation for continuous-domain linear models. In this paper, we introduce two new correlation measures tailored for infinitely divisible random variables with symmetric distribution. For the introduced measures, we prove a number of desired properties that are expected from a useful correlation measure. Finally, we employ these measures in an estimation problem; more specifically, we consider the interpolation problem for the family of Levy processes, and compare the outcome with ´ the known results in the literature.",
