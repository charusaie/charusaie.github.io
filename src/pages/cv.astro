    I'm originally from a <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/ie8brDbjtpwyzLgW9" class="na">small town</a>
        in the west coast of Persian golf in Iran, where I lived all my childhood.
        I moved to Isfahan and Tehran next, bigger cities in Iran to do my bachelor and master
        studies. I have been living in Germany since 2020 and I'm pursuing my
        PhD in computer science in <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/htoBRP5nw3Y7zDtU7" class="na">TÃ¼bingen</a>.
        Living in different parts of Iran and now in Germany has given me the
        chance to know people from different backgrounds and further provided me
        with the chance to learn new languages. Besides my <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandari" class="na">dialect</a>
        and Persian, I speak English, German, and an Iranian dialect of Kurdish.
        <br />
        Besides my academic career, I had a chance to work in electronic
        industry in Iran, where I developed products for sales points.

      During this time, I worked on understanding and further extensions of learn-to-defer systems.
      I designed active learning methods of learning the deferral systems, introduced
      a set of surrogate losses with which one could jointly train a classifier and rejection function,
      extended the notion of learn-to-defer to a more general teaming setting, and worked towards
      formalizing solution to deferral systems under constraints.

      I worked on an alternative to random fourier feature method for generating private 
      synthetic data using kernel mean embeddings. This alternative provably needs
      less amount of features to find a valid representation of the data, which means
      we need less noise to protect the privacy of individuals. Therefore, the quality of the
      generated private data is improved.

      I was conducting research on the intersection of information theory and signal processing.
      I devised an probabilistic generalization of sparsity that gives similar guarantees as sparsity in
      compressed sensing problems.
